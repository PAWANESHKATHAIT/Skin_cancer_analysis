Overview :
This project focuses on analyzing a skin cancer dataset to uncover insights and patterns that could aid in understanding the disease better. Using various Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, the data underwent thorough cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. The final results were visualized through interactive dashboards created in Power BI.

Project Structure :
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas.
Handled missing values using Scikit-Learn's SimpleImputer.
Addressed outliers and inconsistent data entries.
Converted categorical columns to appropriate data types to optimize memory usage.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the data distributions and relationships between features.
Generated plots such as histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to identify patterns and correlations.

Handling Missing Values:
Applied Scikit-Learn's SimpleImputer to fill missing values with appropriate statistics like mean, median, or mode, ensuring the data was complete for analysis.

Power BI Dashboards:
Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize the key findings from the analysis.
The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including demographic distributions, diagnosis patterns, and key insights.

Key Features
Comprehensive Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset was free of errors and inconsistencies, making it ready for analysis.

In-Depth Analysis: Conducted a thorough exploration of the data to identify significant patterns and trends.

Interactive Visualization: Built Power BI dashboards to allow for dynamic exploration of the data, making it easier to communicate insights.
Technologies Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualizing data distributions and relationships.

Scikit-Learn: For handling missing values.

Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize the results.
